    2. In second terminal window: go run demo/demo.go
    Rebalancing factor default setting is 4, can be changed in 
    demo_server.go

To test correctness:
    1. In first terminal window: go run eval/server/correctness_server.go
    2. In second terminal window: go run eval/client/correctness_tests.go
    Rebalancing factor default setting is 4, can be changed in 
    correctness_server.go.

To evaluate performance:
    1. Log onto rice machines.
    2. TODO
